# MORSE: Model Optimization Tools for Remote Sensing Data Analysis

MORSE (Model Optimization tools for Remote Sensing Data Analysis) is a Python-based framework for optimizing machine learning models for multi-modal remote sensing data. It leverages "Optuna" for hyperparameter optimization, SHAP for feature importance and explainability, and various ML models for EO applications. Additionally, it supports feature selection using TPESampler.

A few appplications of this framework at showcased in the following publications -

## Features

- Data preprocessing for remote sensing data and stack objects.
- Multi-objective optimization using NSGA-III sampler (Genetic Optimization) for ML models.
- Dynamic Feature selection using TPESampler (Bayesian Optimization).
- Visualization of predicted maps and spectral plots.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MORSE.git
   cd MORSE
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. For GPU acceleration, install `cupy` with the appropriate CUDA version (optional).

## Usage

1. Place your hyperspectral data (e.g., `.hdr`, or `.stack.joblib` files) in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the main script for regression-based abundance prediction:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. Run the feature selection script for band ratio optimization:

   ```bash
   python src/main_feature_selection.py
   ```
4. Results (models, predictions, visualizations, and band ratios) will be saved to the specified output directory.
